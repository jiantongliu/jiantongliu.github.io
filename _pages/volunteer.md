[Organization for Transformative Works (OTW)](https://www.transformativeworks.org/): Oct 2018 - Present
------

I have worked in three different committees in the past four years, including
* [Translation Committee](https://www.transformativeworks.org/committees/translation/)
* [Tag Wrangling Committee](https://archiveofourown.org/wrangling_guidelines)
* [Support Committee](https://www.transformativeworks.org/committees/support-committee/)

> The Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) is a nonprofit organization established by fans to serve the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fanworks and fan culture in its myriad forms. We believe that fanworks are transformative and that transformative works are legitimate.

> We envision a future in which all fannish works are recognized as legal and transformative and are accepted as a legitimate creative activity. We are proactive and innovative in protecting and defending our work from commercial exploitation and legal challenge. We preserve our fannish economy, values, and creative expression by protecting and nurturing our fellow fans, our work, our commentary, our history, and our identity while providing the broadest possible access to fannish activity for all fans.

> The OTW will preserve the record of our history as we pursue our mission while encouraging new and non-mainstream expressions of cultural identity within fandom.
