We will also introduce an equivariant (stable) version of Brown Representability, which roughly produces an equivalence between equivariant cohomology theories and G-spectra. </td>

            <td colspan=3>The stick number and the edge length of a knot type in simple hexagonal lattice (sh-lattice) are the minimal number of sticks and edges required, respectively, to construct a knot of the given type in sh-lattice. By introducing a linear transformation between lattices, we prove that for any given knot both values in the sh-lattice are strictly less than the values in the cubic lattice. Moreover, we find lower bounds for any given knot‚Äôs stick number and edge length in sh-lattice using these properties in the cubic lattice. Finally, we show that the only non-trivial 11-stick knots in the sh-lattice are the trefoil knot ($3_1$) and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$).
