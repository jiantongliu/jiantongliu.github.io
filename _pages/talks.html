                <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06510">Ramzi, Sosnilo, and Winges's recent paper</a> constructs a functorial assignment that sends each spectrum to a small idempotent complete stable $\infty$-category, known as a categorification of the spectrum. An interesting consequence of this result is a disproof of a conjecture regarding the theorem of heart for non-connective spectra, proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07207">Antieau-Gepner-Heller</a>.</p>

                <p>The Brill-Noether theorem, as a purely algebro-geometric result, is concerned with the mappings of algebraic curves into projective spaces. Classic proofs, such as those by <a href="https://publications.ias.edu/node/229">Griffiths-Harris</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-23/issue-3/Brill-Noether-Petri-without-degenerations/10.4310/jdg/1214440116.full">Lazarsfeld</a>, rely solely on degeneration arguments and properties of vector bundles. However, modern developments have revealed surprising connections between the theorem and combinatorics. In this talk (and the subsequent one), I will present an argument that involves a mixture of degeneration techniques with a combinatorial argument of the chip-firing game from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870812000722">Cools-Draisma-Payne-Robeva</a>.</p>

                <p>We first introduce two notions of cohomology in the equivariant setting, namely Bredon cohomology and Borel cohomology, and we will see how they come up in the proof of Smith Theory. We will also introduce an equivariant (stable) version of Brown Representability, which roughly produces an equivalence between equivariant cohomology theories and G-spectra.</p>

                <p>The stick number and the edge length of a knot type in simple hexagonal lattice (sh-lattice) are the minimal number of sticks and edges required, respectively, to construct a knot of the given type in sh-lattice. By introducing a linear transformation between lattices, we prove that for any given knot both values in the sh-lattice are strictly less than the values in the cubic lattice. Moreover, we find lower bounds for any given knot‚Äôs stick number and edge length in sh-lattice using these properties in the cubic lattice. Finally, we show that the only non-trivial 11-stick knots in the sh-lattice are the trefoil knot ($3_1$) and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$).
