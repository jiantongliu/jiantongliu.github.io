                <p>Recall that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2282">Blumberg, Gepner, and Tabuada</a> constructed a universal (finitary) localizing invariant into some $\infty$-category $\mathcal M_\text{loc}$ corepresenting non-connective K-theory. In particular, that means an equivalence on the corresponding functor categories. However, it is hard to find out anything useful about $\mathcal M_\text{loc}$ a priori because the construction. It turns out that, once restricted to $\operatorname{Cat}_\infty^\text{perf}$, the category $\mathcal M_\text{loc}$ can be thought of as the Dwyer-Kan localization of the category at a class of exact functors, called the motivic equivalences. This was recently proven by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11338">Ramzi, Sosnilo, and Winges</a>. The proof is anchored upon the fact that the category $\operatorname{Cat}_\infty^\text{perf}$ along with this class of functors can be made into a model of cofibration categories, which has nice properties whenever the cofibration category is small. Due to cardinality issues, however, to prove this for $\mathcal M_\text{loc}$, one has to filter the category by a family of small full subcategories given by $\kappa$-compact objects, where each $\kappa$ is countably closed. The choice of countably closed cardinals is nice because 1) there are enough supply of them for a filtration, i.e., given any cardinal, there is a countably closed cardinal bigger than it, and 2) it preserves enough constructions for $\kappa$-compact objects. In particular, once restricting $\operatorname{Cat}_\infty^\text{perf}$ to $\operatorname{Cat}_\infty^{\text{perf}, \kappa}$ for countably closed $\kappa$, we retrieve a small cofibration category by taking corresponding wide subcategories. Therefore it suffices to localize each small subcategory of the filtration, prove that it satisfies the universal property, and then taking a colimit across all such cardinals. One can also be motivated to study $\aleph_1$-finitary localizing invariants, i.e., ones preserving $\aleph_1$-filtered colimits, for instance from the fact that constructions like $\operatorname{TR}$ and $\operatorname{TC}$ are only $\aleph_1$-finitary but not finitary. The proof was done by studying properties of $\aleph_1$-compactness, then extending the properties proved for countably closed cardinals to general cardinals, and inverting a class called "simple motivic equivalences" on the corresponding functor categories. It turns out that the universal $\aleph_1$-finitary localizing invariant coincides with the universal finitary localizing invariant given by $\mathcal M_\text{loc}$.</p>

                <p>The Brill-Noether theorem, as a purely algebro-geometric result, is concerned with the mappings of algebraic curves into projective spaces. Classic proofs, such as those by <a href="https://publications.ias.edu/node/229">Griffiths-Harris</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-23/issue-3/Brill-Noether-Petri-without-degenerations/10.4310/jdg/1214440116.full">Lazarsfeld</a>, rely solely on degeneration arguments and properties of vector bundles. However, modern developments have revealed surprising connections between the theorem and combinatorics. In this talk (and the subsequent one), I will present an argument that involves a mixture of degeneration techniques with a combinatorial argument of the chip-firing game from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870812000722">Cools-Draisma-Payne-Robeva</a>.</p>

                <p>We first introduce two notions of cohomology in the equivariant setting, namely Bredon cohomology and Borel cohomology, and we will see how they come up in the proof of Smith Theory.

                <p>The stick number and the edge length of a knot type in simple hexagonal lattice (sh-lattice) are the minimal number of sticks and edges required, respectively, to construct a knot of the given type in sh-lattice. By introducing a linear transformation between lattices, we prove that for any given knot both values in the sh-lattice are strictly less than the values in the cubic lattice. Moreover, we find lower bounds for any given knot‚Äôs stick number and edge length in sh-lattice using these properties in the cubic lattice. Finally, we show that the only non-trivial 11-stick knots in the sh-lattice are the trefoil knot ($3_1$) and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$).
