Here is a list of my notes and writings related to my coursework. 

Lecture Notes
------

{% include base_path %}

* MATH 110AH/BH/C (Honors Algebra)

* MATH 115AH/B (Honors Linear Algebra)

* MATH 131AH/BH (Honors Analysis)
  * This is the undergraduate Honors analysis series I took in Winter and Spring 2021, taught by [Professor Monica Vi»ôan](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~visan/). The core textbook for this series is Baby Rudin. 
  * <a href = "../files/131H_Notes.pdf">Course Notes</a>, finished updating notes and homework of 131AH. 


* MATH 134/135/136 (Chaos and Differential Equations)

* MATH 191 (Category Theory)
  * This is an undergrauate Honors seminar couse I took in Spring 2021, taught by Dr. Jonathan Rubin. The course covered the entire [_Category Theory in Context_](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf) book by Emily Riehl.


* MATH 205A (Algebraic Number Theory)
  * This is the first course in the graduate number theory course series. I took this course in Fall 2022 with [Professor Romyar Sharifi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sharifi/). The recommended text for this course is [Professor's lecture notes](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sharifi/algnum.pdf). 
  * <a href = "../files/205A_Notes.pdf">Course Notes</a>

* MATH 210A/B/C (Graduate Algebra)
  * This is the graduate algebra series I took (and will be taking) in Fall 2021, Winter 2023, and Spring 2023, taught by [Professor Alexander Merkurjev](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~merkurev/). 
  * <a href = "../files/Graduate_Algebra_Book.pdf">Course Notes and Other Related Materials</a> (under construction)

* MATH 212A/B (Homological Algebra)
  * This is the homological algebra series I took in Winter 2022 and Winter 2023, taught by [Professor Paul Balmer](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/).
  * Lecture notes of 212A is still under preparation.

Writings
------

* <a href = "../files/On_Calculation_of_Class_Numbers.pdf">On Calculation of Class Numbers</a>
  * In this document, we discuss the relevant concepts and techniques involved in calculating the class number of a number field, as well as give a few examples of such calculations.
