Here is a list of my notes and writings related to my coursework. You can also find a comprehensive courselist [here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/coursework.html). 

Lecture Notes
------

{% include base_path %}

* MATH 110AH/BH/C (Honors Algebra)

* MATH 115AH/B (Honors Linear Algebra)

* MATH 131AH/BH (Honors Analysis)
  * This is the undergraduate Honors analysis series I took in Winter and Spring 2021, taught by [Professor Monica Vișan](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~visan/). The core textbook for this series is Baby Rudin. 
  * <a href = "../files/131H_Notes.pdf">Course Notes</a>


* MATH 134/135/136 (Chaos and Differential Equations)
  * This is a series in differential equations, taught by [Dr. Jiajun Tong](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~tongj/) (134, 135) and [Professor Marcus Roper](https://www.marcusroper.org/) (136). 
  * <a href = "../files/Differential_Equations_Notes.pdf">Course Notes (under construction)</a>

* MATH 191 (Category Theory)
  * This is an undergrauate Honors seminar couse I took in Spring 2021, taught by Dr. Jonathan Rubin. The course covered the entire [_Category Theory in Context_](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf) book by Emily Riehl.


* MATH 205A (Algebraic Number Theory)
  * This is the first course in the graduate number theory course series. I took this course in Fall 2022 with [Professor Romyar Sharifi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sharifi/). The recommended text for this course is [Professor's lecture notes](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~sharifi/algnum.pdf).

* MATH 210A/B/C (Graduate Algebra)
  * This is the graduate algebra series I took (and will be taking) in Fall 2021, Winter 2023, and Spring 2023, taught by [Professor Alexander Merkurjev](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~merkurev/). 
  * <a href = "../files/Graduate_Algebra_Book.pdf">Course Notes and Other Related Materials</a> (under construction)

* MATH 212A/B (Homological Algebra)
  * This is the homological algebra series I took in Winter 2022 and Winter 2023, taught by [Professor Paul Balmer](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer/).
  * Lecture notes of 212A is still under preparation.

Writings
------
* <a href = "../files/Hatcher_Solution_Master_Document.pdf">Solutions of Hatcher's _Algebraic Topology_</a>, ongoing project (password requried)

* <a href = "../files/Hilbert_s_Nullstellensatz.pdf">On Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a>
  * This document is a general survey that introduces different concepts built up upon rings, including ideals, domains, and a little bit of algebraic geometry, so that we can make our way to (various statements of) Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. 

* <a href = "../files/On_Calculation_of_Class_Numbers.pdf">On Calculation of Class Numbers</a>
  * In this document, we discuss the relevant concepts and techniques involved in calculating the class number of a number field, as well as give a few examples of such calculations.
