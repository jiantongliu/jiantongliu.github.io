[Organization for Transformative Works (OTW)](https://www.transformativeworks.org/): Oct 2018 - Present
------

I have worked in three different committees in the past four years. 

> The Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) is a nonprofit organization established by fans to serve the interests of fans by providing access to and preserving the history of fanworks and fan culture in its myriad forms. We believe that fanworks are transformative and that transformative works are legitimate.
