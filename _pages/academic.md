Academic Work
======

Grader (Fall 2020 - Summer 2022)
------
I worked as a grader for two years, mostly graded MATH 115AH (Honors Linear Algebra). I also graded MATH 115 (Linear Algebra) and MATH 105 Series (Mathematics for Teaching) from time to time. 

Math Research Experience as an Undergraduate (Summer 2021, Summer 2022)
------
* UCLA CAM REU (Summer 2021)
  * I worked in the Los Angeles GRYD Program (Gang Reduction Youth Development) research team and focused on compartmental modeling, stability analysis, and center manifold theory. The results were integrated as part of a final report "A Compartmental Model for the Dynamics of Gang Embeddedness and Youth Delinquency" along with a final presentation at the end of the REU program. My supervisors were Dr. David Hyde, Dr. Chuntian Wang, Dr. Andrea Bertozzi, Dr. Paul Brantingham, and Yotam Yaniv.
* Polymath Jr (Summer 2022)
  * (Under construction.)

Teaching Experience (Fall 2021 - Expected Spring 2023)
------
I am an assistant instructor at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle](https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/). 
* I taught the Intermediate 2B class online during the 2021-2022 academic year. The topics include Number Theory, Algebra, Graph Theory, and Algorithms.
* I will be teaching the Intermediate 2A class in-person during the 2022-2023 academic year. 


Psychology Research Experience (Fall 2022 - Expected Winter 2023)
