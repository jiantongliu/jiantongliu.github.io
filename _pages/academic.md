Grader (Fall 2020 - Summer 2022)
------
I worked as a grader for two years, graded homework, quizzes and tests and provided feedback for many courses, including:
* MATH 115AH (Honors Linear Algebra): Fall 2020 - Winter 2022
* MATH 115A (Linear Algebra): Summer 2021, Summer 2022
* MATH 105 Series (Mathematics and Pedagogy for Teaching Secondary Mathematics): Fall 2021 - Spring 2022


Math Research Experience as an Undergraduate (Summer 2021, Summer 2022)
------
* UCLA CAM REU (Summer 2021)
  * Worked in the Los Angeles GRYD Program (Gang Reduction Youth Development) research team and focused on compartmental modeling and stability analysis by using center manifold theory and dynamical systems. The results constituted an important part of the final report "A Compartmental Model for the Dynamics of Gang Embeddedness and Youth Delinquency" and the final presentation at the end of the REU program. 
  * Supervisors: Professor David Hyde, Professor Chuntian Wang, Professor Andrea Bertozzi, Professor Paul Brantingham, and Yotam Yaniv.
* Polymath Jr (Summer 2022)
  * Work on a project in combinatorial knot theory under the supervision of Professor Marion Campisi of San Jose State University. The project mostly focuses on knots in simple hexagonal lattices, where we study the stick number and other properties of knots.
  * Represented the group to give a talk at the final colloquium of the program.
  * Uploaded the preprint article to arXiv in November 2022. Acted as corresponding author for its publication. 
  * Represented the group to give a talk at the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in January 2023. 
  * Supervisors: Professor Marion Campisi, Nicholas Cazet

Teaching Experience (Fall 2021 - Expected Spring 2023)
------
I am an assistant instructor at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle](https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/). 
* I taught the Intermediate 2B class online during the 2021-2022 academic year. The topics include Number Theory, Algebra, Graph Theory, and Algorithms.
* I am teaching the Intermediate 2A class in-person during the 2022-2023 academic year. 


Directed Reading Program Mentee (Winter 2022 - Fall 2022)
------
I participated in the program to study advanced topics in mathematics under the supervision of [Ben Spitz](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~benspitz/), a PhD student at UCLA. I also participated in the program colloquiums and talked about what I learned from the topics.

* Winter 2022 Topic: Enriched Category Theory, reading [_Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory_](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10.pdf) by [Max Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kelly). 

* Spring 2022 Topic: Algebraic Number Theory, reading [_Algebraic Number Theory_](http://www.math.toronto.edu/~ila/Neukirch_Algebraic_number_theory.pdf) by [JÃ¼rgen Neukirch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Neukirch). 

* Fall 2022 Topic: Algebraic Topology, reading [_Algebraic Topology_](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) by [Allen Hatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Hatcher). 

Psychology Lab Research Assistant (Fall 2022 - Expected Winter 2023)
------
I am currently a research assistant of [Zili Lab at UCLA](https://zililab.psych.ucla.edu/), working on a research project related to [motion perception](https://zililab.psych.ucla.edu/research/shape-from-motion/).
