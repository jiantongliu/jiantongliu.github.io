I am a first-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2023, studying pure math and cognitive science. [Here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/files/Jiantong_Liu_CV.pdf) is my CV. 

In spring 2024, I am a teaching assistant for MATH 257 (Linear Algebra with Computational Applications). 

General Research Interest
------
I am interested in [abstract nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense) like algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory, and homotopy theory, as well as their applications. More recently, I am interested in $\mathbb A^1$-homotopy theory and motivic cohomology.
