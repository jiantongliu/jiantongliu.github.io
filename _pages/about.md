Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a fourth year student at UCLA, studying pure math and cognitive science. 

General Research Interest
======
While I am doing a double major, my focus of study is in mathematics and I will pursue a PhD program in mathematics after this year. I am mostly interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, and sometimes I also like to work on category theory. 

Academic-related Work
======

Grader (Fall 2020 - Summer 2022)
------
I worked as a grader for two years, mostly graded MATH 115AH (Honors Linear Algebra). I also graded MATH 115 (Linear Algebra) and MATH 105 Series (Mathematics for Teaching) from time to time. 

Math Research Experience as an Undergraduate (Summer 2021, Summer 2022)

Teaching Experience (Fall 2021 - Expected Spring 2023)
------
I am an assistant instructor at the [UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle](https://circles.math.ucla.edu/circles/). 
* I taught the Intermediate 2B class online during the 2021-2022 academic year. The topics include Number Theory, Algebra, Graph Theory, and Algorithms.
* I will be teaching the Intermediate 2A class in-person during the 2022-2023 academic year.
