Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a fourth-year student at UCLA, studying pure math and cognitive science. A full version of my CV can also be found <a href = "../files/Jiantong_Liu_CV.pdf"> here</a>. 

General Research Interest
======
As a double major, my research interest is in mathematics and I am thinking of pursuing a Ph.D. program in mathematics after graduation. I am mostly interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, and I also have interest in other fields such as category theory and homotopy type theory.
