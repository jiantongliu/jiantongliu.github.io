Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a fourth year student at UCLA, studying pure math and cognitive science. 

General Research Interest
======
Notwithstanding the double major, my research interest is in mathematics and I am thinking of pursuing a Ph.D. program in mathematics after graduation. I am mostly interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, and I also have interest in other fields such as category theory.
