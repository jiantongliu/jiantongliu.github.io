Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a fourth-year student at UCLA, studying pure math and cognitive science. I will be a Ph.D. student in mathematics at UIUC starting in Fall 2023. [Here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/files/Jiantong_Liu_CV_2023.pdf) is a copy of my CV. 

General Research Interest
------
As of right now, I am mostly interested in abstract nonsense like algebraic topology, category theory, and homotopy theory. I am also interested in PDEs and dynamics, as well as mathematical logic like proof theory and homotopy type theory.  

Education
------
* B.S. in Mathematics (Highest Departmental Honors), UCLA, 2023
* B.S. in Cognitive Science, with Specialization in Computing, UCLA, 2023
