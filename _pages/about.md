Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a first-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring pure math and cognitive science. [Here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/files/Jiantong_Liu_CV_2023.pdf) is my CV. 

General Research Interest
------
I am currently interested in abstract nonsense like algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and category theory. I am also interested in PDEs and dynamics, as well as mathematical logic like proof theory and homotopy type theory.  

In Fall 2023, I am doing a reading course with [Professor Jeremiah Heller](https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jbheller) on algebraic K-theory. 

Education
------
* B.S. in Mathematics, with Highest Departmental Honors, UCLA, 2023
* B.S. in Cognitive Science, with Specialization in Computing, UCLA, 2023
