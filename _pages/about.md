Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a fourth-year student at UCLA, studying pure math and cognitive science. 

General Research Interest
======
As a double major, my research interest is in mathematics and I am thinking of pursuing a Ph.D. program in mathematics after graduation. My interest includes:
* Category Theory, and its ramifications in other disciplines such as algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and homotopy type theory. 
* Partial Differential Equations, as well as dynamics and chaos in these systems. 
* Cognitive Science, focusing on cognition and memory.
