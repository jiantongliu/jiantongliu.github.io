Hello there! My name is Jiantong Liu and I am a first-year Ph.D. student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring pure math and cognitive science. [Here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/files/Jiantong_Liu_CV_2023.pdf) is a copy of my CV. 

General Research Interest
------
Currently, I am interested in abstract nonsense like algebraic topology, category theory, and homotopy theory. I am also interested in PDEs and dynamics, as well as mathematical logic like proof theory and homotopy type theory.  

Education
------
* B.S. in Mathematics, with Highest Departmental Honors, UCLA, 2023
* B.S. in Cognitive Science, with Specialization in Computing, UCLA, 2023
