Hi there, my name is Jiantong Liu and I am a fourth year student at UCLA, studying pure math and cognitive science. 

General Research Interest
======
While I am doing a double major, my focus of study is in mathematics and I will pursue a PhD program in mathematics after this year. I am mostly interested in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, and sometimes I also like to work on category theory. 

Academic-related Work

Grader
------
I worked as a grader for two years, mostly graded MATH 115AH (Honors Linear Algebra). I also graded MATH 115 (Linear Algebra) and MATH 105 Series (Mathematics for Teaching) from time to time.
