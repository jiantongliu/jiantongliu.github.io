I am a third-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), studying pure math and cognitive science. [Here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/files/Jiantong_Liu_CV.pdf) is my CV. 

General Research Interest
------
I am mostly interested in homotopy theory. Currently, I am thinking about 
* norm functors in motivic homotopy theory (possibly without $ùî∏^1$-invariance),
* algebraic K-theory, and its applications in both motivic and chromatic homotopy theory.
