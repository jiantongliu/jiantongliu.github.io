I am a second-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2023, studying pure math and cognitive science. [Here](https://jiantongliu.github.io/files/Jiantong_Liu_CV.pdf) is my CV. 

General Research Interest
------
I am interested in [abstract nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense) like algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, as well as their applications. More specifically, my research interest lies in algebraic K-theory and its applications in motivic homotopy theory. 

Current Teaching
------
In Fall 2024, I am teaching MATH 257 (Linear Algebra with Computational Applications).
