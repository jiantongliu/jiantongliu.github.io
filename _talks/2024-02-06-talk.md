We first introduce two notions of cohomology in the equivariant setting, namely Bredon cohomology and Borel cohomology, and we will see how they come up in the proof of Smith Theory. We will also introduce an equivariant (stable) version of Brown Representability, which roughly produces an equivalence between equivariant cohomology theories and G-spectra.
