Given an exact category $\mathcal A$, there are two natural notions of K-groups on $\mathcal A$, one is given by the K-group of the Quillen exact structure, and the other is given by the K-group of the symmetric monoidal structure on its subcategory $S = i\mathcal A$, the isomorphism category of $\mathcal A$. It was observed by Quillen and later on proven by Grayson in his [1976 paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0080003) that the two notions agree under mild assumptions, and in particular the K-groups of a ring $R$ agree with the K-groups of $\mathcal P(R)$, the category of finitely-generated projective $R$-modules.
