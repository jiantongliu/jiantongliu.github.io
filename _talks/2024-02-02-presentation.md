Given an exact category $\mathcal A$, there are two natural notions of K-groups on $\mathcal A$, one is given by the K-group of the Quillen exact structure, and the other is given by the K-group of the symmetric monoidal structure on its subcategory $S = i\mathcal A$, the isomorphism category of $\mathcal A$. We study the properties of the $S^{-1}S$-construction from Grayson's [1976 paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0080003).
