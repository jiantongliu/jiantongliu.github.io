Ramzi, Sosnilo, and Winges's recent paper [_Every Spectrum is the K-theory of a Stable Infinity Category_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06510) constructs a functorial assignment that sends each spectrum to a small idempotent complete stable $\infty$-category, known as a categorification of the spectrum. An interesting consequence of this result is a disproof of a conjecture regarding the theorem of heart for non-connective spectra, proposed in [_K-theoretic Obstructions to Bounded t-structures_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07207).
