The Brill-Noether theorem, as a purely algebro-geometric result, is concerned with the mappings of algebraic curves into projective spaces. Classic proofs, such as those by [Griffiths-Harris](https://publications.ias.edu/node/229) and [Lazarsfeld](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-23/issue-3/Brill-Noether-Petri-without-degenerations/10.4310/jdg/1214440116.full), rely solely on degeneration arguments and properties of vector bundles. However, modern developments have revealed surprising connections between the theorem and combinatorics. In this talk (and the subsequent one), I will present an argument that involves a mixture of degeneration techniques with a combinatorial argument of the chip-firing game from [Cools-Draisma-Payne-Robeva](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870812000722).
