Before starting any discussion about étale topology or étale cohomology, we introduce the Zariski descent theory over fpqc and/or fppf morphisms, which includes descent of quasi-coherent sheaves, descent of properties of morphisms, descent of schemes, as well as an argument that allows "passage to limit" through a directed system. Roughly speaking, a descent asks for uniqueness/recoverability of gluing along the pullback (as a notion of restriction), which generalizes the gluing condition on a topology. With the categorical formulation of descent data, we allow a generalization of descent theory over Zariski topology to over étale topology and/or with respect to a covering, or over general fibered categories over sites.
