We gave an overview of Suslin's K-theory of algebraically closed fields, which can be found in his [1983 paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01394024), [1984 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404984900434), and his [1986 ICM talk](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/algebraic-k-theory-of-fields). Using Quillen's theorems, we introduced crucial properties developed in his [1983 paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01394024), and constructed specialization map for closed points on a curve.
