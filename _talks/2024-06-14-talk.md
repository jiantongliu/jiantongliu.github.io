Roughly speaking, étale cohomology is the algebraic analogue of singular cohomology, and is finer than the Zariski topology. As we study sheaves over Zariski topology on a topological space (therefore associated to the small Zariski site), having a stronger topology then allows us to study schemes over étale topology on the small étale site. It turns out that étale cohomology also has strong connections with many other cohomologies, e.g., Galois cohomology, and Čech cohomology. We will justify the said analogue by studying flasque sheaves and the higher direct image functor. Finally, we will show that étale cohomology has properties similar to those in the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms.
