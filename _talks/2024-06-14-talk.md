Being an analogue of sheaf cohomology but for schemes, étale cohomology gives a cohomology theory on the (small) étale site, and has strong connections with many other cohomologies, e.g., Galois cohomology and Čech cohomology. We will justify the said analogue by studying flasque sheaves and the higher direct image functor. Finally, we will show that étale cohomology has properties similar to those in the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms.
